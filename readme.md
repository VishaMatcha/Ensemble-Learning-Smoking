# **Smoking Prediction using Machine Learning**

## **Project Overview**
This study aims to create a **predictive model** that can differentiate between **smokers and non-smokers** using a variety of **health-related factors**. Smoking is a major **risk factor** for several health conditions, and the ability to accurately classify individuals based on their health metrics has **significant implications** for **targeted healthcare initiatives and policy-making**.

## **Dataset**
The dataset used for this project is publicly available on **Kaggle** and contains **various health indicators** such as:
- **Blood pressure levels**
- **Cholesterol levels**
- **Hearing capacity**
- **General medical history**
- **Lifestyle factors**  
It is used to train different machine learning models to classify individuals as **smokers or non-smokers**.
