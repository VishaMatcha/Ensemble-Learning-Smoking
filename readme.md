# **Smoking Prediction using Machine Learning**

## **Project Overview**
This study aims to create a **predictive model** that can differentiate between **smokers and non-smokers** using a variety of **health-related factors**. Smoking is a major **risk factor** for several health conditions, and the ability to accurately classify individuals based on their health metrics has **significant implications** for **targeted healthcare initiatives and policy-making**.

## **Dataset**
The dataset used for this project is publicly available on **Kaggle** and contains **various health indicators** such as:
- **Blood pressure levels**
- **Cholesterol levels**
- **Hearing capacity**
- **General medical history**
- **Lifestyle factors**  
It is used to train different machine learning models to classify individuals as **smokers or non-smokers**.

## **Results & Findings**
The results from various models show their ability to predict smoking status. Below are the key findings:

### **1. Hyperparameter Tuning Results**
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier (GB)**
  - Best Accuracy: **85% (Sklearn), 84% (Scratch)**
  - Best Precision: **86%**
- **Neural Network**
  - Best Accuracy: **83%**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  - Accuracy: **82% (Scratch), 83% (Sklearn)**

### **2. Model Comparison (Cross Validation)**
| Model                  | Scratch Accuracy | Sklearn Accuracy |
|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Gradient Boosting**  | 84%             | 85%             |
| **Neural Network**     | 82%             | 83%             |
| **SVM**               | 82%             | 83%             |
| **Random Forest**      | 82%             | 100% (Overfitting Issue) |
| **AdaBoost**          | 75%             | 78%             |

ðŸ“Œ **Key Insights:**
- **Gradient Boosting and Neural Networks performed best** in terms of **accuracy and generalization**.
- **Random Forest (Sklearn) showed overfitting**, achieving **100% accuracy** on training data but lower generalization on validation.
- **The ensemble model (hard voting) provided stable predictions**, leveraging the strengths of multiple classifiers.
